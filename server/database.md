# Set up your databse

(Start simple, can always make it complex later)

## STEP 1: PLAN your tables

- Think about how many tables you need.
  - Possibly two? One for posts, one for categories?
- How do I connect the tables --> Is it many-to-many (junction table) or one-to-many relationships? (have one category for many posts)
- Visually draw tbales on drawSQL.

## STEP 2: Write your SQL queries to create your tables and seed the data

## STEP 3: Connect your tables to the server
