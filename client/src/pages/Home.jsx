//This is the first page the user will see --> the root
//It can be the same as App

//Routing help!
//I wrapped my app in main.jsx with Browser router
//I will build my routes in the root componenet (App or Home)

//Routes should wrap your Route
//Route has teo attributes --> path for your params; and element, for the componenet you want to render in that path
//For user navigation, seperatly you will have Link componenets
//the Link componenet has an attribute calles to="" to specify the params we are navigating to
